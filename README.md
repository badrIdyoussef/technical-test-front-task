## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/technical-test-front-task.git
    cd technical-test-front-task
    ```

2. **Copy the environment configuration**:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser
    ```

    `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://dummyjson.com`


## ‚úÖ Requirements to Implement (Mandatory)

‚úÖ **Auth Facade** (simulated session) with **guards**: Redirect to `/login` if the user is not authenticated.
‚úÖ **/products**: Implement search (with debounce), category filters, pagination, and UI states (loading, error, empty).
‚úÖ **/orders**: Display **carts** from the DummyJSON API (readonly), and optionally, create a **‚ÄúLocal Orders‚Äù** section after a simulated checkout.
‚úÖ **/metrics**: Display KPIs for users (from DummyJSON), orders & revenue for the last 7 days (local), and a mini chart.
‚úÖ **Quality**: Focus on typed code, reusable components, accessibility, and responsiveness.

## üß© Key Files to Complete

‚úÖ **`src/lib/api.ts`**: All the fetch functions are **TODO** (to be implemented).
‚úÖ **`src/lib/auth.ts`**: Implement functions such as `isAuthed`, `setToken`, and `clearToken`.
‚úÖ **`src/components/Guard.tsx`**: Activate the redirection logic once the authentication flow is ready.
‚úÖ **`src/app/*/page.tsx`**: Implement each page (marked as **TODO**).

## üß™ Minimum Tests

**Note:** These tests are **not fully implemented** yet. The basic structure in place, but the test coverage is still under development.

- Implement at least **2 component tests** and **1 integration test** (your choice).

## üß™ Running Tests

To run the tests in the project, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure dependencies are installed**:
    If you haven‚Äôt already installed the project dependencies, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run unit and integration tests**:
    You can run the tests using **Vitest** . To run all the tests, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```

    This will execute all the tests in the project.
